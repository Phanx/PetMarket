PetMarket
=========

Scans the auction house for unowned battle pets. Written by Timothy Johnson
(RedHatter21). This GitHub repository contains fixes and updates by Phanx.

To install the addon from GitHub:

1. [Download the current repository as a ZIP file.](https://github.com/haste/oUF/archive/master.zip)
   (Long way: Click the green "Clone or download" button at the top of the page,
   then click "Download ZIP" in the popup.)
2. Rename the folder it contains from "PetMarket-master" to "PetMarket".
3. Copy the "PetMarket" folder into your AddOns folder.
4. If you don't already have the Ace3 and LibPetJournal-2.0 libraries installed,
   either by themselves or embedded in other addons, you will need to download
   and install them as separate addons:
   * [Ace3](https://www.wowace.com/addons/ace3/)
   * [LibPetJournal-2.0](https://wow.curseforge.com/addons/libpetjournal-2-0/)

If you already have the original version of PetMarket installed, you should
delete it first, as some files it contains are no longer used.

You can find the original version of [PetMarket on CurseForge](https://wow.curseforge.com/addons/petmarket/).
