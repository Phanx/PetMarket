Scans the auction house for unowned battle pets.  
Written by Timothy Johnson (RedHatter21).

This GitHub repository contains fixes and updates by Phanx. To install
the addon from GitHub:

1. Click the "Download ZIP" button on the left side of the page.
2. Rename the folder it contains from "PetMarket-master" to "PetMarket".
3. Copy the "PetMarket" folder into your AddOns folder.
4. If you do not already have the Ace3 and LibPetJournal-2.0 libraries
   installed, either by themselves or embedded in other addons, you will
   need to download and install them as separate addons:
   * [Ace3](http://www.wowace.com/addons/ace3/)
   * [LibPetJournal-2.0](http://wow.curseforge.com/addons/libpetjournal-2-0/)

If you already have the original version of PetMarket installed, you
should delete it first, as some files it contains are no longer used.

You can find the original version of PetMarket:

* [on Curse.com](http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/petmarket)
* [on CurseForge.com](http://wow.curseforge.com/addons/petmarket/)
